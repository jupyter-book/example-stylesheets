# Styling Blocks

With [blocks](xref:guide/blocks#blocks), you can apply a class to the container of an entire section of top-level content, e.g. styling all blockquotes in a given block:

> Block quotes are cool
>
> -- The MyST Team

:::{literalinclude} style.css
:start-after: BEGIN-BLOCK
:end-before: END-BLOCK
:::

This page has an outer [block](xref:guide/blocks#blocks) with the class `styled-block`.
